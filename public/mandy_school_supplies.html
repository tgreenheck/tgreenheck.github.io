      <h2>Wizarding Currency</h2>
      <p>We in the wizarding community have our own currency. Not to worry, you can exchange your money at Gringotts bank! There are Galleons, Sickles and Knuts. There are 29 Knuts to a Sickle and 17 Sickles to a Galleons. Gringotts employs Goblins, do NOT stare. If your funds are insufficient, Hogwarts will you send you some.</p>

      <h2>Diagon Alley</h2>
      <p>Diagon Alley has everything you need to get your child set for school. How to get here? Located in London, behind the Leaky Cauldron(you may need to concentrate), you&#39;ll need to go to the back, locate a dustbin and tap the appropriate brick (three up and two across from the bin). Here you will find all the shops you will need to get everything on the supply list. Ollivander's Wand Shop is a nice play to start. Please be warned, do stay away from Knockturn Alley, if you find yourself there, turn around and go back the way you came.
