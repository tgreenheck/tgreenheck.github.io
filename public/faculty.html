            Set Gryffindors apart;<br />
            You might belong in Hufflepuff,<br />

            Those patient Hufflepuffs are true,<br />
            And unafraid of toil;<br />
            Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,<br />
            If you've a ready mind,<br />
            Where those of wit and learning,<br />
            Will always find their kind;<br />
            Or perhaps in Slytherin,<br />
            You'll make your real friends,<br />

            To achieve their ends.”<br />
